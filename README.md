- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @securitystuffbackup
I made backup of content send in : https://t.me/hackgit
I'm not a bot so it can take time to do it

- I don't fork in github anymore but in [GitLab]() And soon BitBucket

## Why Gitlab and BitBucket ?

They are not like microsoft, who delted repository and impose some stuppid rules for forking (No more thant 240 per day)
And also provide a better speed (And mirroring in the same platforme isn't the best thing in the world)
